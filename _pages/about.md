I’m a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley with experience as a quantitative trading intern at Citadel Securities and a software engineering intern at MVTec. I’m broadly interested in systematic trading, algorithmic game theory, and applied machine learning.

In my free time, I enjoy card games, photography, hiking in nearby national parks, skiing, and tennis.
